## üêû Bug: Duplicate Cart Documents Causing Index Creation Failure

### Issue
During deployment, if multiple cart documents exist for the same `userId`, the `cart-service` container fails with the following error:
Failed to find cart: Query { "$java" : Query: { "userId" : "6803507dfec18f03a95e406f"}, Fields: {}, Sort: {} } returned non unique result

### Cause
This occurs because a **unique index on `userId`** is being created during initialization, but **duplicate documents already exist** in the `carts` collection.

### Fix
issue is resolved by adding an initContainer to the Kubernetes deployment of the cart-servic 
This container ensures that:
-Any existing duplicate cart documents for the same user are removed.
-A unique index is created on the userId field to prevent duplicates in the future

This fix ensures that each user can only have one cart document, maintaining data integrity and preventing runtime errors in the service.
